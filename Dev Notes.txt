/mu-plugins/custom-post-types.php **I used this folder outside of the AWI folder because I was taught to put custom post types
                                    in the mu-plugins folder. This prevents those custom types from being deleted if the theme
                                    is ever changed. **

Synopsis:
On Monday, I spent my time downloading the boilerplate, getting the site set up on my server, and coding all the HTML structure.
On Tuesday, I did all the styling except for the footer, for full-size viewports.
On Wednesday, I finished the full-sized styling, created the custom post types and ACF, and did all the responsive styling.

I developed everything in VS Code, and tested functionality in Firefox and Chrome.
